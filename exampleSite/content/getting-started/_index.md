Built on Hugo, a static site generator, the `hugo-cloudflare-docs` contains the frontend templates and styles for building great developer sites and documentation at Cloudflare. This repo powers the sites listed below.

### Developer Documentation Sites

- **[Access Docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/access/)** – [EA/access-docs](https://stash.cfops.it/projects/EA/repos/access-docs)
- **[Workers Docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)** – [EW/workers-docs](https://stash.cfops.it/projects/EW/repos/workers-docs)
- **[Warp Docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/warp/)** – [TUN/warp-docs](https://stash.cfops.it/projects/TUN/repos/warp-docs)
- **[Stream Docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/stream/)**
- **[Mobile SDK](https://developers.cloudflare.com/mobile-sdk/)**
- and many more upcoming...

If you’d like to create a new documentation site for a Cloudflare product, create a new repo modelled after one of these and you’ll be ready to go.

### Other Sites

- **[Cloudflare Developers site](https://developers.cloudflare.com/)** – [PS/developer-docs](https://stash.cfops.it/projects/PS/repos/developer-docs)
- **[Incidents Status site](https://incidents.cfdata.org/)** – [PLAT/incident-status-hugo](https://stash.cfops.it/projects/PLAT/repos/incident-status-hugo)

If you’d like to contribute to the look and feel of all of the docs, then make a PR on this repo, [DESIGN/hugo-cloudflare-docs](https://stash.cfops.it/projects/DESIGN/repos/hugo-cloudflare-docs).

Good luck!
